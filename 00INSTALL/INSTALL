Installation of comskip under wine (Wine Is Not an Emulator) on debian

Comskip is a windows program.  To run it under the penguin required use of wine.

Comskip uses a .ini file inside it's directory which holds the settings for how it will detect
commercials.  It seems the program will have false positives and false negatives in its detection
regardless of how hard you try to set it up.  However, I think I have a decent .ini file that
seems to work better than the default settings, and I have seen it work perfectly 75% of the time
for me.  I am still working on making it even better, so it is a work in progress, so I will link
to a version on my website so I can upload the whenever I think I have found better settings.
