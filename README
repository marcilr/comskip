  Comskip is a free mpeg commercial detector.  It is a windows console
  application that reads a mpeg file and analyses the content based on a large
  amount of configurable parameters.  After analysis it generates a file in
  various possible formats containing the location of the commercials inside
  the mpeg file.  The formats include input files for Personal Video
  applications like SageTV or GBPVR, interactive video editors (VideoRedo,
  Cuttermaran,Mpeg2Schnitt...) command line video cutters (mpgtx, cuttermaran,
  mencoder) and video players (zoomplayer, mplayer, ...).  Comskip can read MPEG
  and h.264 video and MPEG2, AC3 and AAC audio from PS, TS and dvr-ms files upto
  HD resolution (max 2000x1200) at 25fps (PAL) and 29.97fps (NTSC).  The h.264
  and WTV version is still in beta test and available for donators.  Comskip can
  NOT read copy protected recordings.
